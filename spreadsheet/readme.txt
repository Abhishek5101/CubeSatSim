These spreadsheets are for analyzing the CubeSat Simulator telemetry.

Instructions:

Copy your raw telemetry data into the tab/sheet "Paste Raw Data Here".

If it is AFSK telemetry from AFSK 1200 Decoder, you will need to delete every other row which has the timestamp.  You can use a macro to do this.  Select a row at the top that has a timestamp, and type Control-t and every other line will be deleted.

Once you have one frame of telemetry per line and no extra lines, copy and paste into the tab/sheet, "Data Input"

The telemetry starting in Row 2 will be calculated and plotted.

See plots in "Voltage Graphs", "Current Graphs", and "Temperature Graphs"
