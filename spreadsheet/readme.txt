These spreadsheets are for analyzing the CubeSat Simulator telemetry.

Instructions:

Copy your raw telemetry data into the Data Input tab.  If you don't have any data, copy data from the Sample Data tab.

The odd rows should be a time timestamp (which is ignored) while the even rows should contain frames of telemetry data (beginning with "hi hi" then a series of 3 digit numbers).  If this isn't the case, you will need to edit until even lines starting at row 2 contain frames of telemetry.

The telemetry starting in Row 2 will be automatically calculated and plotted.

See plots in Voltage Graphs, Current Graphs, and Temperature Graph tabs.
