## Overview

The AX5043 library provides an interface to program the transceiver. The library is currently configured with the following settings:

- Carrier Frequency - 435.3 MHz
- Symbol Rate - 4.8 kS/s
- Modulation - GFSK
- Transmit Deviation - 13.6 kHz
- Transmit Power - 15.0 dBm
- Receive Bandwidth - 28.2 kHz
- Encoding: HDLC with FEC
- Error Detection: CRC-16

## Next Steps

Over time, the AX5043 library will have new functions to change these settings.
